# Fundamental Differences

**World Bank API** → Data updated in real-time through an HTTP request
(JSON format).

**Kaggle API** → Only provides datasets already published by users or
Kaggle itself. The data is **not** automatically updated like with the
World Bank.

On Kaggle, you must first download the dataset (CSV, XLSX, etc.) and
then import it locally with Pandas. The API does not allow direct
"querying" like a live service.
